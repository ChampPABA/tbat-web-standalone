# Frontend-Backend Integration Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### âœ… **Database & Infrastructure**
- [ ] PostgreSQL database is running and accessible
- [ ] Prisma schema is up to date (`npx prisma db push`)
- [ ] Redis cache is configured and running
- [ ] Vercel Edge Config is set up with package data
- [ ] Environment variables are configured:
  - `DATABASE_URL`
  - `REDIS_URL`
  - `EDGE_CONFIG`
  - `SENTRY_DSN`
  - `SENTRY_ENABLED`

### âœ… **API Endpoints Testing**
- [ ] `GET /api/packages` returns valid response
- [ ] `GET /api/capacity` returns valid response  
- [ ] `GET /api/sessions` returns valid response
- [ ] All endpoints handle rate limiting properly
- [ ] Error responses include proper Thai messages
- [ ] Response times are under target (200ms for capacity, 1000ms for others)

### âœ… **Frontend Integration**
- [ ] usePackages hook connects to live API
- [ ] useCapacity hook polls every 30 seconds
- [ ] useSessions hook connects to live API
- [ ] Fallback to mock data works when APIs fail
- [ ] Loading states display properly
- [ ] Error boundaries catch and display Thai errors
- [ ] Offline detection works correctly

### âœ… **Monitoring & Analytics**
- [ ] Sentry is configured and receiving errors
- [ ] Performance monitoring is tracking API calls
- [ ] Capacity update metrics are being recorded
- [ ] Fallback activation is being tracked
- [ ] Critical alerts are configured

## Deployment Steps

### 1. **Pre-deployment Testing**
```bash
# Run full test suite
npm run test
npm run test:e2e

# Build and verify
npm run build
npm run start

# Check API endpoints
curl http://localhost:3000/api/packages
curl http://localhost:3000/api/capacity
curl http://localhost:3000/api/sessions
```

### 2. **Database Migration** (if needed)
```bash
# Apply any pending migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Seed initial data if needed
npx prisma db seed
```

### 3. **Deploy to Vercel**
```bash
# Deploy to staging first
vercel --env=staging

# Verify staging deployment
# Test all critical flows

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### 4. **Post-deployment Verification**
- [ ] All API endpoints are responding in production
- [ ] Real-time capacity updates are working
- [ ] Error monitoring is active (check Sentry dashboard)
- [ ] Performance metrics are being collected
- [ ] Thai language displays correctly
- [ ] Mobile experience is working properly

## Monitoring Setup

### **Critical Metrics to Watch** (First 24 hours)
- API response times (target: <200ms for capacity, <1000ms for others)
- API success rate (target: >99%)
- Capacity update success rate (target: >95%)
- Fallback activation rate (target: <5%)
- Error rate (target: <1%)
- User experience loading times (target: <3 seconds)

### **Alerting Thresholds**
- API response time > 2000ms
- API error rate > 5%
- Capacity update failures > 3 consecutive
- Critical security events
- Database connection failures

## Rollback Plan

### **If Issues Occur:**
1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous deployment
   vercel rollback
   ```

2. **Fallback Mode**
   - APIs will automatically fallback to mock data
   - Users will see warning messages but can continue
   - Monitor logs for specific error patterns

3. **Debug Information**
   - Check Sentry for error details
   - Review API response times in Vercel Analytics
   - Check database connection status
   - Verify Redis cache is working

## Performance Optimization

### **Expected Performance Gains**
- Real-time capacity data (30-second refresh)
- Improved error handling with Thai messages
- Smooth loading states and transitions
- Client-side caching reduces API calls
- Graceful degradation during outages

### **Performance Targets**
- Landing page load: <3 seconds
- Capacity data refresh: <500ms
- Package selection: <1 second
- Error recovery: <2 seconds
- Mobile performance: 90+ Lighthouse score

## Security Considerations

### **Data Protection**
- All API calls use HTTPS
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Error messages don't expose sensitive data
- Thai data protection (PDPA) compliance maintained
- Audit logging for all critical actions

### **Monitoring**
- Security events logged to database
- Critical alerts sent to administrators
- Failed authentication attempts tracked
- Rate limit violations monitored

## Success Criteria

### **Technical Success**
- [ ] All 6 tasks completed successfully
- [ ] API integration working without issues
- [ ] Real-time updates functioning properly
- [ ] Error handling graceful and user-friendly
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting active

### **Business Success**
- [ ] Users see accurate real-time availability
- [ ] Thai language experience is smooth
- [ ] Mobile users have good experience
- [ ] System handles expected load (20 concurrent users)
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms work during issues

## Post-Launch Tasks

### **Week 1**
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics daily
- [ ] Review error logs and fix issues
- [ ] Collect user feedback on new features
- [ ] Optimize based on real usage patterns

### **Week 2-4**
- [ ] Analyze capacity update patterns
- [ ] Optimize polling intervals if needed
- [ ] Review and tune caching strategies
- [ ] Plan performance improvements
